# Vue.js Blog Website

This is a project to help me learn how to use Vue.js with the help of this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBZVDsB4VMA) from Net Ninja.

### Process

The tutorials have been really good, following the code and trying things out. When the lessons started using webpack to create this blog, the difficulty went up a few notches. There are a lot of auto generated files, as well as complex routing of import and exporting which can be quite confusing.

When you add complexity like this, its quite prone to mistakes from happening, which is what happened to me on many occasions, which were nearly always some form of typo or missing piece of code.

It was quite cool to link my blog to firebase so easily, and was glad that we could create json files like this to output data in hashes. Since with Vue, a lot of the data is stored in the hash format with key/value pairs, which I quite like.

I really like the ease of readability of the syntax, especially within the HTML tags, like using the @click symbol to represent a click event, allowing for shorter code and clear intent.

Although it has not been my own content, creating this blog has given me a better insight into how websites can be made and structured, and I have learned a lot!
